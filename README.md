# mnzakish
`mnzakish`, or `msh` for short, is a framework of shell tools to manage and
interact with a Personal Knowledge Base composed of markdown and media files.

_msh_ is pronounced like the Arabic "مِشّْ " or the German "mich", not like the
English "mesh". Note that the German and Arabic pronounciation are not similar.



## Typical session

first we j ump there
```
j

`si` stands for "set intention"
